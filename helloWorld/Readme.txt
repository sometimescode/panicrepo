HelloWorld
a) CREATE BASE PROJECT

2) Installed apache-tomcat
3) mvn archetype:generate
>struts2
>8
>48
groupid: com.demo
artfactid: helloWorld (will be the name of generated WAR file)
^ DOESN'T RUN. Had to modify pom.xml to use some parts of code found in generating a Maven Webapp Project through VSCODE to make it run.

b) TRANSFER FILES
1) Extract SampleApplication
2) Duplicate and Rename (or just rename) HelloWorld.war to HelloWorld.zip.
3) Extract HelloWorld.zip
4) Open created HelloWorld folder
5) Transfer [chapterTwo] and [menu] folders into your project's WEB-INF folder
6) Go to [WEB-INF >src>manning] folder and copy [chapterTwo] into your project's  java/com/demo folder. 
7) In your project's newly added chapterTwo folder:
• move chapterTwo.xml into your project's resource folder
• update HelloWorld.java to reflect current format of .java files (see the .java files under [example] folder of your project for reference)
8) Go to [WEB-INF>src] and modify your project's struts.xml using the struts.xml found in that folder. Update the path of include file since we didn't use manning/chapterTwo folders.
